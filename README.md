## About

With Project Fonos, [Fonoster Inc](https://fonoster.com). researches an innovative Programmable Telecommunications Stack that will allow for a completely cloud-based utility for businesses to connect telephony services with the internet.

Project Fonos was conceived of by [Pedro Sanders](https://github.com/psanders). In conducting market research for his newly formed business, Mr. Sanders spoke with CTO’s and market leaders in the industry and found that there was a need for an innovative approach to communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS.)

Project Fonos aims to be a solution for businesses needing to add voice, video, and messaging features to their websites and applications. Businesses are, in most cases, unable to accomplish this independently due to the complexity and number of telephony services involved in the task. Instead, businesses rely on third-party providers that offer software as a service (SaaS) that allow for communication between telephony devices and internet-based API’s, services, etc. 

The primary innovation of Project Fonos lies in researching and developing the means for creating a highly portable, extensible, full feature, cloud-based Programmable Telecommunications Stack. Using this form of CPaaS, businesses will be able to call up an API to dial, answer a call, establish a video session, send SMS, etc., all with just HTTP requests and without worrying what servers and networks are doing with that information in the background. For Project Fonos to be a viable alternative to existing CPaaS, the system must be portable. Therefore, Project Fonos must take advantage of the various cloud environments such as Kubernetes and AWS ECS to run solutions at scale. Guaranteeing portability for the Project Fonos will also mean ensuring the deployability of the system using a "single-click-install" when possible.

### Where are we today?

As you can imagine this is an enormous task and will need all hands on deck and a lot of resources. Since we are a small team we decided to focus on a few use-cases. Once we are doing those use-cases really well we will move to the next-one.

The first few releases of Project Fonos will focus only on Programmable Voice. We decided to focus on Programmable Voice, because it has the least amount of alternatives to its private CPaaS counterpart. 

### Who is Project Fonos for?

Although Project Fonos is expected to be useful for all businesses at all levels, its initial target group is expected to be made up of entrepreneurial start-ups. Focusing on organizations in this segment allows Project Fonos to address concerns that are directly related to small business which depend on Programmable Telecommunications. Specifically, Project Fonos wants to address the following pain points for start-ups: 

**High Prices:**
- Top competitors dictate prices with no regulations
- Low margins for product-makers
- Costs are difficult to forecast

**Vendor lock:**
- Difficulty migrating from one vendor to another
- Limited to vendor's feature (can't add or remove)

**Privacy Concerns:**

- Government/military unable to benefit 
- Health organization have limited access on many countries

**Technical Complexity:**

- Learning curve for those without coding knowledge
- Copious documentation required
